I am a Lead Research Scientist at Yandex Research, leading the Visual GenAI team. Broadly, my work focuses on exploring limitations in existing generative paradigms and developing more practical and natural solutions. One of my key directions is improving model efficiency to make large-scale visual generative models more accessible. Also, I am interested in extending the use of generative models for various downstream tasks, e.g., leveraging them as strong backbones or data engines for discriminative problems. Recently, we launched a 3D reconstruction direction aimed at building generative methods for novel view synthesis and relighting, particularly in the context of driving scenes.

In addition, I organize research seminars on generative CV and teach the Visual GenAI course at the Yandex School of Data Analysis.

**Previously:** I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at HSE University in December 2024, advised by [Artem Babenko](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=2Kv3JP0AAAAJ&hl=en). In 2022, I was a research intern at Meta AI, where I worked on large-scale vector search and retrieval-augmented language models, advised by [Matthijs Douze](https://ai.meta.com/people/804301491840160/matthijs-douze/) and [Zeki Yalniz](https://ai.meta.com/people/274060152308398/i-zeki-yalniz/). Earlier, in 2019, I interned at ETH Zurich, working with [Vincent Fortuin](https://fortuin.github.io/) and [Stephan Mandt](https://www.stephanmandt.com/) on generative modeling for missing data imputation.
