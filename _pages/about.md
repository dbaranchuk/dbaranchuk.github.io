I am a Lead Research Scientist at Yandex Research. My work broadly focuses on diffusion-based models and exploring effective synergies between different generative paradigms. One of my key directions is making large-scale visual generative models more efficient and practical for real-world use. I am also highly interested in extending the use of generative models to various downstream tasks, e.g., leveraging them as strong feature extractors or data engines for discriminative problems.

In addition to my research, I organize seminars on generative models, post paper reviews, and teach the Visual GenAI course at the Yandex School of Data Analysis.

**Previously:** I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at HSE University in December 2024, advised by [Artem Babenko](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=2Kv3JP0AAAAJ&hl=en). In 2022, I was a research intern at Meta AI, where I worked on large-scale vector search and retrieval-augmented language models, advised by [Matthijs Douze](https://ai.meta.com/people/804301491840160/matthijs-douze/) and [Zeki Yalniz](https://ai.meta.com/people/274060152308398/i-zeki-yalniz/). Earlier, in 2019, I interned at ETH Zurich, working with [Vincent Fortuin](https://fortuin.github.io/) and [Stephan Mandt](https://www.stephanmandt.com/) on generative modeling for missing data imputation.
